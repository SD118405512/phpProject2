	<h2>Traveling!</h2>
	<p>Traveling is something I love to do, experiencing new cultures and people and also enjoying the better weather a lot of countries have to offer is really fun and interesting.</p>

	<p>
		
            Traveling is something I've been doing since I was very young as I was lucky enough to have parents who also liked to travel. Since I was young I've been to a good few European countries, lived in Boston for 2 years and traveled to Tokyo on work experience.
	</p>
	<p>
		Countries I'd love to visit in the future are places like Australia, Canada, Asia, Bali and Russia. Experiencing their food and their culture would be something I know I would really enjoy and cherish.
