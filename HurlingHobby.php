	<h2>Hurling!</h2>
	<p>Hurling has been my passion since I've been a young boy. The thrill I get from hurling is second to none.</p>

	<p>
		I play with a team called Sarsfields in Glanmire, and I have been playing for them since I was 6 years old. The reason I liked hurling so much was the passion all my friends and I had for playing and winning games and also the friends I made over the years of playing are all friends for life. The competitive nature of the sport was also somthing that drew me in, when championship came around the games of hurling would jump up a gear and it was so enjoyable to play.
	</p>
	<p>
		The level of fitness that hurling kept me at also contributed to the love I have for the sport. The extremely intense training sessions we'd endure during the winters to be fit for the summer games although painfully demanding had us all in the best shapes of our lives and was a great way to keep us busy. The teamwork skills and communication skills we all learned from playing this fantastic sport was just another reason we all loved this sport so much
