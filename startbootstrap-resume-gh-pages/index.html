        <h3> Hurling </h3>
        <p>I currently play hurling with Sarsfields u21’s. Hurling is my passion. I’ve been playing all my life and this has greatly helped me develop my abilities to work in a team and be assertive on and off the field.
×         I also played with the Dean Ryan cup team and Harty cup team during my time in Christians where we won the Dean Ryan cup and also did very well the three years I played in the Harty Cup.</p>
        <h3> Gym </h3>
        <p class="mb-0"> I also love going to the gym and have been lifting weights for about 5 years. I train 4/5 times a week and follow a strict diet which helps me develop good discipline and dedication.</p>
