	<h2>Surfing!</h2>
	<p>Surfing is new hobby of mine and the first time my friends took me out to the ocean I was hooked.</p>

	<p>
		This year my friends asked me did I want to go along with them surfing in west cork and I went to see what is was like. We went into the ocean with our boards and wetsuits and after an hour or so I was hooked. The mixture of cold peaceful water while you're waiting for the next wave and the adrenaline rush when you catch a wave is a perfect combo for me, which is why I think I love surfing so much

		The cold therapy you get from the cold Irish sea is very refreshing and good for resetting your brain for the week ahead, it's almost camparable to meditating.
